# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# App Configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The environment in which the application is running. This should be set to
# 'production' on your live server to enable security features like secure
# cookies. For local development, 'development' is appropriate.
PY_ENV=development

# The network port on which the Flask server will listen for incoming
# connections. Change this if port 3000 is already in use on your system.
PORT=3000

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Session Configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A long, random, and secret string used to sign the session and cookies.
# This prevents the session from being tampered with. It must be kept private.
# Generate a secure key using:
# python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
SESSION_SECRET="your-very-secret-and-strong-session-key"

# The total duration of the session in seconds. After this period of
# inactivity, the user will be effectively logged out.
# Default is 3600, which is 1 hour (60 * 60).
SESSION_DURATION=3600

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ZITADEL OpenID Connect (OIDC) Configuration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The full domain URL of your ZITADEL instance. You can find this in your
# ZITADEL organization's settings.
# Example: https://my-org-a1b2c3.zitadel.cloud
ZITADEL_DOMAIN="https://your-zitadel-domain"

# The unique Client ID for your application, obtained from the ZITADEL Console.
# This identifier tells ZITADEL which application is making the request.
ZITADEL_CLIENT_ID="your-zitadel-application-client-id"

# While the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE for public clients does not
# strictly require a client secret for OIDC specification compliance, Authlib
# will still require a value for its internal configuration.
# Generate a secure key using:
# python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
ZITADEL_CLIENT_SECRET="your-randomly-generated-client-secret"

# The full URL where ZITADEL redirects the user after they have authenticated.
# This MUST exactly match one of the "Redirect URIs" you have configured in
# your ZITADEL application settings.
ZITADEL_CALLBACK_URL="http://localhost:3000/auth/callback"

# The internal URL within your application where users are sent after a
# successful login is processed at the callback URL.
# Defaults to "/profile" if not specified.
ZITADEL_POST_LOGIN_URL="/profile"

# The full URL where ZITADEL redirects the user after they have logged out.
# This MUST exactly match one of the "Post Logout Redirect URIs" configured
# in your ZITADEL application settings.
ZITADEL_POST_LOGOUT_URL="http://localhost:3000/auth/logout/callback"
